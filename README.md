[Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/LisaATaylor/SpringboardML/blob/master/logistic_regression/Mini_Project_Logistic_Regression_LAT.ipynb)  train test split, accuracy score, regularization, grid search cross-validation, visualization of classification output

[Naive Bayes:](https://github.com/LisaATaylor/SpringboardML/blob/master/logistic_regression/Mini_Project_Logistic_Regression_LAT.ipynb)  text classification, count vectorizer, cosine similarity, sklearn MultinomialNB, hyperparameter tuning, log likelihood scoring, ROC and PR curves, TF-IDF weighting

[Clustering:](https://github.com/LisaATaylor/naip-classify) Customer segmentation, selection of KNN K with elbow method and silhouette plots, visualization with PCA, other clustering algorithms in sklearn (agglomerative, DBSCAN, etc.)
